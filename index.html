              Our Company has launched a new product. But we’re spending so much
              fixing our supply chain? How can you help?
            </div>

            <p>
              Congrats on your new product line. The key is to understand what’s
              more valuable for your business at this current stage.
            </p>

            <p>
              Does your supply chain bring more value & profit In the long run?
              or, does your new product show more profitability that allows you
              take the burn for a short period of time?
            </p>

            <p>
              This can be answered by analyzing and auditing your financial
              statements for the past 3 months.

              Our latest marketing campaign didn’t go as well as we had planned.
              How can you help?

            <p>
              A key piece of advice - all campaigns usually boost your sales
              only about 10% (Directly). It’s important to not compare your
              average sales figures directly with your post campaign sales
              period.
            </p>

            <p>
              Your focus should be on making campaigns that have high retention
              & brand recall value. This can contribute to your sales indirectly
              as well. Analysing the parameters in a short span usually doesn’t
              help.
            </p>

            <p>
              We can help you design your campaigns that cater to different
              consumer segments, testing, feedback & more. Write to us and we’ll
